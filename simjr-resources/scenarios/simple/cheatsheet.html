<h2>About Sim Jr Cheat Sheets
<p><b>This is a Sim Jr cheat sheet</b> defined in <i>simple/cheatsheet.html</i>. It's just normal HTML. Links can include embedded Sim Jr JavaScript by using the <b>simjr:</b> scheme like this:</p>
<pre>
   &lt;a href="simjr:simulation.setPaused(false)"&gt;Run&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

Additional JavaScript functions can be defined in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> as usual.

<p>Here are some examples of things you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="simjr:simulation.setPaused(false)">run</a> the simulation</li>
<li>You can <a href="simjr:simulation.setPaused(true)">pause</a> the simulation</li>
<li>You can <a href="simjr:showEntity(null,%22hello%22)">center the view on an entity</a></li>

<li>You can 
	<a href="simjr:selectEntity(%22hello%22)">select an entity</a>
   and 
    <a href="simjr:createManualController()">
    create a manual controller</a>
   for it.
</li>

<li>You can even create <a href="http://www.google.com">links</a> to external sites</li>
</ul>
